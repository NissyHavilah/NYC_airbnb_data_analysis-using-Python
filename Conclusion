Throughout the project, we conducted an engaging analysis of the New York City Airbnb dataset and addressed several key questions, including:

Which region has the highest number of listings? 
How does Average price differ based on the region?
How do the numbers of shared room listings compare to private room and entire home/apartment listings?
How does price vary based on the room type?
Which regions in New York are the most expensive to stay in?

To achieve these objectives, we undertook significant data manipulation tasks, including data exploration, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

With all that said, the conclusions are:

Over 70% of the rooms are located in Manhattan and Brooklyn, which are also the most expensive regions.
Average price is high in Manhattan followed by Brooklyn.
There are far fewer shared room listings compared to private rooms and entire homes/apartments. Entire homes/apartments have the highest number of listings
The price distribution based on room type shows that 57% of the listings are for entire homes/apartments, 24.2% are private rooms, and 18.9% are shared rooms.
Manhattan is the most expensive region to stay in New York City, if you want to stay close to the major attractions of the city you'll probably expend more money.
